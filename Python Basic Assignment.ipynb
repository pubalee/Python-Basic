        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "Ans: Python is a versatile, high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and ease of use.\n",
        "It is popular among industries for following reason:\n",
        "-Ease of Learning\n",
        "-Versatality\n",
        "-Lots of Libraries\n",
        "-Huge active community\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python\n",
        "Ans: In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, without requiring it to be compiled into machine code first. It translates the code into machine-readable instructions and then executes them directly. E.g: VS code, Pycham, Google colab etc..\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        "Ans: Following are the pre-defined keywords in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "False               class               from                or\n",
        "None                continue            global              pass\n",
        "True                def                 if                  raise\n",
        "and                 del                 import              return\n",
        "as                  elif                in                  try\n",
        "assert              else                is                  while\n",
        "async               except              lambda              with\n",
        "await               finally             nonlocal            yield\n",
        "break               for                 not   \n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        "Ans: No, Variables canot be keywords\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python\n",
        "Ans: In Python, mutability refers to an object's ability to be modified after it is created. Mutable objects can have their values or contents changed without creating a new object, while immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "Ans:Lists are mutable but tuples are immutable because once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed. In contrast, lists are mutable, meaning that their contents can be modified after they are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        "Ans: Difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in Pyhthon are :\n",
        "\n",
        "      \"==\"                                         \"is\"\n",
        "Checks for value equality                   Checks for object identity\n",
        "Compares the content or data of objects     Compares memory addresses of objects\n",
        "True if values are equal                    True if both variables refer to the same object\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python\n",
        "Ans: THere are three logical operators in Python,namely : 'and' , 'or' and 'not'\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        "Ans: Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of changing a variable's data type from one to another.\n",
        "e.g:\n",
        "a=\"3.5\"\n",
        "type(a)\n",
        "str\n",
        "type(float(a))\n",
        "float\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        "Ans: Implicit type casting, also known as widening or upcasting, is automatically performed by the compiler when a smaller data type is converted to a larger one. Explicit type casting, also known as narrowing or downcasting, requires the programmer to explicitly convert a larger data type to a smaller one, often involving the risk of data loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        "Ans: Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of execution of a program based on whether a specific condition is true or false.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work\n",
        "Ans: 'Elif' stands for 'else if' and is used in Python programming to test multiple conditions. It is written following an if statement in Python to check an alternative condition if the first condition is false. The code block under the elif statement will be executed only if its condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        "Ans:The main difference between for and while loops is that for loops iterate over a sequence (like a list or array), while while loops continue executing as long as a condition is true. In essence, for loops are used when you know the number of iterations beforehand, and while loops are used when the number of iterations is determined by a dynamic condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop\n",
        "Ans:For loops are best used when you know the number of iterations ahead of time, whereas a while loop is best used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance.\n",
        "E.g: #For iteration and counting I prefer using for loops,\n",
        "for (int i=0; i<10; ++i) {\n",
        "  /* body */\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "# On the other hand, reading from files I usually prefer while lops:\n",
        "while (!eof(file_handle)) {\n",
        "  /* read from file */\n",
        "}\n",
